    "Welcome to the Five-Day Executive Training Program on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence for Financial Data Analysis, Forecasting, and Fraud Detection. This intensive, hands-on program is tailored for professionals and decision-makers in the banking and financial sectors who are eager to harness the power of AI to drive innovation, enhance operational efficiency, and combat financial fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the five days, participants will delve into AI techniques‚Äîfrom statistical analysis and time series forecasting to deep learning models such as CNN. Blending theory with practical coding exercises and real-world case studies using public datasets, this program empowers attendees with the knowledge and tools to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze and visualize complex financial datasets,\n",
    "- Perform financial data visualization and analysis using Python,\n",
    "- Build decision-making models using techniques like Decision Trees,\n",
    "- Detect fraud in transactional data and handwritten checks,\n",
    "- Authenticate signatures through advanced deep learning models,\n",
    "- Use local Large Language Model to process financial dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the program, participants will be equipped with practical technical skills, modern AI tools, and a strategic perspective on integrating intelligent systems into financial operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs begin the journey of transforming financial insights into intelligent action.\n",
