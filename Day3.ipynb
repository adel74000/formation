    "Machine learning plays a transformative role in financial data analysis by enabling automated decision-making and predictive modeling; classification algorithms like Decision Trees and SVMs are widely used to identify patterns and categorize financial records—such as credit approval, fraud detection, or risk profiling—based on historical features, while regression models utilizing the same techniques help forecast continuous variables like stock prices, interest rates, or portfolio returns, allowing institutions to anticipate market trends and optimize strategies with improved accuracy and efficiency.\n",

    "- Regresion on time series data.\n",

Specifically, it demonstrates how models like Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be applied to structured tabular data for predicting categorical outcomes such as loan approval status; how those same models, can be leveraged for time series regression to forecast numerical financial values such as stock prices — highlighting the versatility of machine learning across diverse financial data types and use cases."

    "\n",
    "In the context of the financial dataset loan_approval_dataset.csv, classification refers to the task of predicting whether a loan application will be approved or rejected, based on various applicant features provided in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to build a model that learns patterns from historical data to accurately assign each new application to one of two classes:\n",
    "- Approved (1 or \"Y\")\n",
    "- Rejected (0 or \"N\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a decision making system used to automate the loan approval process and identify high-risk applications early.\n",

    "🧠 Used Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Tree: Easy to interpret rule-based model that splits data into subgroups,\n",
    "- SVM (Support Vector Machine): Powerful model that finds an optimal boundary between approval and rejection.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 Objective: Train and evaluate these models on historical loan data to predict future approvals and improve loan portfolio quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Objective:\n",
    "- Step 1 – Load and Preprocess the Tabular Financial Dataset,\n",

    "- Drop non-relevant columns : Columns like 'Loan_id', which serve only as identifiers and do not carry meaningful information for prediction, are removed from the dataset to avoid unnecessary noise in model training.\n",
    "- Split the data into training and testing sets : The dataset is divided into two parts: a training set (typically 80%) used to train the model, and a testing set (typically 20%) used to evaluate how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.\n",
    "- Separate features from the target variable : The input variables (features) used for making decisions are separated from the target variable (label), which in this case is 'loan_status',\n",

    "A Support Vector Regression (SVR) is the regression counterpart of SVM. Instead of finding a boundary that separates classes, SVR finds a function that approximates the true relationship between input features and a continuous target value, such that most data points fall within a margin of tolerance (ε) from the predicted function.\n",
